PBGE is a game engine built over the famous Blender 3D tool. It is internally integrated in such a way that what you see in the Blender viewport (EEVEE) is what you will see in-game.


Thanks to this integration we have:

    No need for an import-export pipeline. Since Blender supports 3D modelling, sculpting and UV mapping, everything made in the UPBGE can be used "as is".
    Rapid iteration. Simply pressing the "P" key will start your game in the active viewport, allowing you to get instant feedback both visually and in terms of gameplay and logic.
    Implicit updates. All the new features for Blender are automatically included in each UPBGE release.
    A unified workflow. The game engine specific workspaces, editors, panels and nodes follow the same conventions and standards as Blender itself.
